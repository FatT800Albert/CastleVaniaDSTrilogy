PoR Dracula pointers:

022E50BC = Bat moon travel distance (right)

022E50C0 = Bat moon travel distance (left)

022E5118 = Bat moon size

022E5340 = animation duration after bat moon 

022E5794 = hell meatball spawn amount

022E57D0 = affects meatball spawn width

022E57EC = Meatball fireball height (upper)

022E57F4 = Meatball fireball height (lower)

022E5B0C = delay after each teleport. Vanilla 58

022E6104 = timer for super moves

If 022E6104 is 01 and 022E5B0C is 10 drac will do supermove always after hell meatball

022E62E0 = exit teleport beam width

022E6560 = enter teleport beam width

022E65C8 = enter teleport beam duration

022E6B74 = exit teleport bat flight speed

022E6D30 = enter teleport materalizing speed

022E7274 = fireball spawn location (X-axis) (when facing right)

022E7280 = fireball spawn location (X-axis) (when facing left)

022E7398 = middle fireball starting travel speed

022E73A0 = fireball spread

022E73C4 = 5th top fireball height

022E73D0 = 5th top fireball strating travel speed

022E73D8 = 5th bottom fireball height

022E7530 = fireballs position duration. If made bigger they spread really well. 90 works well

022E758C = fireball travel speed

022E779C = meatball spawn location (X-axis) (when facing right)

022E77A0 = meatball spawn location (X-axis) (when facing left)

022E7BF8 = bat moon swarm spread rando
